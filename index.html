            Navid loves designing, specifically <b>good</b> design that makes sense. Example he loves a phone that is almost all screen but he <b>detestes</b> a phone with large bezels surrounding the screen. He always loves looking into technology, especially concepts of future products available in the market. He recently started enjoying code more after he gained a better understanding of Hyper Text Markup Language and Cascading Style Sheets, also known as HTML and CSS. FACT TIME!: Did you know that every website on the World Wide Web is powered by HTMl And CSS Code! Something strange is that every tag of code in HTML looks like a Div Tag when the website is up and running lol. Anywaaaaaaaay… I hope you enjoy my little Web Page and also… Have a GREAT DAY!!
